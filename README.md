# Interactive Step-by-Step Order Builder

This project is an interactive step-by-step order builder that allows users to create and customize their orders in a seamless and user-friendly manner. Users will be guided through a series of steps, each representing a specific selection or customization for their order. The interface ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience, accommodating various devices' screen sizes and offering hover and focus states for all interactive elements.

## Key Features

1. **Step-by-Step Order Builder:** Users can progress through a sequence of steps to build their order. They have the flexibility to go back to previous steps and update their selections before finalizing their order.

2. **Summary and Order Confirmation:** At the final step, users are presented with a comprehensive summary of their selections. They can review their order before confirming it for processing.

3. **Responsive Design:** The interface adapts to different device screen sizes, ensuring a visually appealing and functional layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Interactive Element Feedback:** All interactive elements, such as buttons and checkboxes, offer hover and focus states, providing visual feedback to users as they interact with the application.

5. **Form Validation:** The order builder includes form validation to ensure a smooth and error-free ordering process. Users receive clear validation messages if they miss required fields, input an incorrectly formatted email address, or attempt to submit a step without making any selections.
